# hyperfish

A web application that combines three ideas:
* Peter Henderson's Functional Geometry: an implentation of the picture combinators in Henderson's paper.
* The URL as a stack of values: each part of the path representing a picture, a function or a number.
* Hypermedia affordances: the values on the stack determine which operations are available to the user.
